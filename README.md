# Shorting Visualization

## Scope

### Objective :-
The main  of the  project is to create a web application as a visualization tool.

### Statement of work:-
 A single-page web application built using modern JavaScript technology that will visualize the flow and logic of various sorting algorithms. 

### Deliverables and milestones:-
The UI will contain options to select one of the sorting algorithms which were implemented and several items or elements in the data array, control buttons to start, pause, navigate to previous or next steps along with an option for sorting speed and colour mode.
 The data array of the selected size will be filled in with randomly generated unique values. The data set is represented as a vertical bar with the height of their respective values. After the sorting is started, the stepwise arrangement of data in ascending order based on their value/height will be visualized in the UI.

### Constraints :-
This web application does not support the visualisation of any other algorithms other than sorting.
