# Shorting Visualization

## ABSTRACT

Algorithm is an integral part of computers and programming. It provides consistency in solving similar tasks with a predictable and desirable outcome. Among algorithms, sorting algorithms are regarded as the gateway to the world of algorithms in programming. Evident by their definition, they are used to sorting data set with similar properties. There are various types of sorting algorithms with their distinct implementations and strategies. They are often not as easy to understand and absorb.

A possible contributing factor can be the lack of visualization of the process and steps each one takes to accomplish the task of sorting. Thus, the objective of this project is to create a web application as a visualization tool.

Basic understanding of programming languages.
For common sorting algorithms namely -> Bubble sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort etc. Â 
The result is a web application built using React and other modern JavaScript technologies.

The application UI is able to visualize the sorting process using various colors or denote the status of the elements in the array. It includes features to select the size of the data (array of random numbers), visualization speed, sorting algorithm, Code of the algorithm implemented in multiple languages like C, C++, Java etc. The main objective of the project is met.

## Characteristics of existing system
- Limited sorting algorithms
- Supports feature of Random array.  
- Easy to use.
- Provides simple interface. 
- New array is generated every time.
- Customizable speed and size. 

## Characteristics of proposed system (how it differs from existing system?)
- It is a Dynamic web application.
- It provides facility of multiple sorting algorithms.
- It provides Rich interface.
- It has a facility of Pause/play.
- It gives description of each sorting technique.
- It exhibits time and space complexity.
- Code implementation in multiple languages.
- Sorting can be done in Ascending or descending order.
- It produces Sound while sorting.
- Element range can be selected(10 to 1000).
- Easy to use.

## Scope

### Objective :-
The main  of the  project is to create a web application as a visualization tool.

### Statement of work:-
 A multi-page web application built using modern JavaScript technology that will visualize the flow and logic of various sorting algorithms. 

### Deliverables and milestones:-
The UI will contain options to select one of the sorting algorithms which were implemented and several items or elements in the data array, control buttons to start, pause, navigate to previous or next steps along with an option for sorting speed and colour mode.
 The data array of the selected size will be filled in with randomly generated unique values. The data set is represented as a vertical bar with the height of their respective values. After the sorting is started, the stepwise arrangement of data in ascending order based on their value/height will be visualized in the UI.

### Constraints :-
This web application does not support the visualisation of any other algorithms other than sorting.
